🚀 Getting Started with Create React App
This project was initialized using Create React App, a quick way to set up a modern React development environment.

📜 Available Scripts
In your project directory, you can run the following commands:

npm start
Launches the app in development mode.
Visit http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will auto-reload on code changes, and linting errors will appear in the console.

npm test
Starts the test runner in watch mode.
Ideal for running unit tests interactively as you develop.

npm run build
Creates a production-ready build of your app in the build/ folder.
It bundles and minifies your code for optimized performance.
Build files will include hashes in their filenames for cache optimization.

npm run eject
⚠️ Caution: This action is irreversible.

If you need full control over configuration (e.g., Webpack, Babel, ESLint), you can eject.
This copies all dependencies and config files into your project, removing the abstraction of Create React App.

Note: Most projects don’t need to eject. The default setup is powerful enough for most apps.
